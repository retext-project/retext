ReText is a simple but powerful editor for Markdown and reStructuredText markup
languages. One can also add support for [custom markups] using Python modules.

To install ReText, make sure that you have [Python] (3.6 or later) installed,
and run `pip3 install ReText`. By default it installs system wide, pass
`--user` for installing into the user’s home directory. You can also manually
download the tarball from [PyPI].

ReText requires the following Python modules to run (`pip` will install them
automatically):

* [PyQt6](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/)
* [Markups](https://pypi.org/project/Markups/) (2.0 or later)
* [Markdown](https://pypi.org/project/Markdown/) — for Markdown support
* [docutils](https://pypi.org/project/docutils/) — for reStructuredText support

We also recommend having these packages installed:

* [pyenchant](https://pypi.org/project/pyenchant/) — for spell checking support
* [chardet](https://pypi.org/project/chardet/) — for encoding detection support
* [PyQt6-WebEngine](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6-WebEngine/) — a more
  powerful preview engine with JavaScript support

Translation files are already compiled for release tarballs and will be
automatically loaded. For development snapshots, compile translations using
`lrelease ReText/locale/*.ts` command (on Debian-based systems, use
`/usr/lib/qt6/bin/lrelease` from `qt6-l10n-tools` package). Translation files
can also be loaded from `/usr/share/retext/` directory.

You can translate ReText into your language on [Transifex].
